## Usage

The Digital Clock component automatically updates the time every second. It displays the time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM indicators. The clock is styled to be centered on the page with a background image.

## Code Overview

- **`DigitalClock.js`**: This file contains the main logic for the digital clock. It uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the state and update the time every second.

- **`styles.css`**: The corresponding CSS file provides styling for the digital clock. Key styling features include:
  - A background image that covers the entire viewport.
  - A clock display that is centered on the screen.
  - A backdrop blur effect behind the clock text.

    ```css
    *{
        padding: 0;
        margin: 0;
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    body{
        background-image: url('C:\REACT PROGRAMS\my-react-app\src\assets\background.avif');
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: center;
        background-attachment: fixed;
        background-size: cover;
        height: 100vh;
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
    }
